# median

These are some simple implementations of median finding algorithms we
discussed in my Algorithms class. Thought I would conduct some
"empirical" fact finding to see which is better.

I have also added a longest sub-sequence algorithm as well. My
intention is to test when the performance gains of memoization kick in.
